About
-----

Oftentimes it is desirable to exclusively change very specific
components of a file's modification, access, or change time; however,
the method provided by the conventional touch utility appears
inadequate for this basic task. Moreover, easily modifying a file's
change time is not possible at all.

Stroke offers a solution by providing a user with an advanced
interface which also allows her to utilize an extensive syntax to
dynamically specify certain date and time components to be altered.

All in all stroke can be seen as a potent touch alternative that
leaves a user with more options and freedom. Give your files a hefty
stroke, don't just touch them.

For detailed information on how to use stroke please consult the
manual page `stroke (1)'.


Installation
------------
For a basic installation, executing the following sequence of commands 
in your system's shell should suffice in most cases:

		`./configure'
		`make'
		`sudo make install'

Please note that in order to install stroke properly you have to be
logged in as root or use the `sudo' program as shown in the last of
the above steps.

To obtain a list of all possible options to the configuration script,
you may exectute `./configure --help'.

If you intend to set up stroke in debugging mode you may do so by
entering `./configure --enable-debug'

For more advanced installation options, please see the `./INSTALL'
file for additional instructions.


Installation faults
-------------------

Although stroke as a whole has been designed to be as portable as
possible you might very unlikely encountered a situation in which
compilation and installation fail - maybe due to some unusual system.

Please contact the package maintainer named in the section below
to report this obvious bug.
