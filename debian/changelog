stroke (0.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Breaking change: CLI interface has completely changed; no longer compatible
  * Modernize the CLI grammar and timestamp parsing around parse-datetime,
    enabling ISO8601, natural language, and relative expressions by default.
  * Improve privilege handling and diagnostics for ctime operations to be more
    helpful on systems without CAP_SYS_TIME.
  * Emit ISO-formatted timestamp output without the legacy `stroke:` prefix
    for friendlier scripting.

stroke (0.1.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Initial Debian re-package
    - Original upstream package (stroke_0.1.3-1_i386.deb) was too outdated
    - Provide watch file for SourceForge releases.
